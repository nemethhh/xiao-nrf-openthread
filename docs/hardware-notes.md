## Flashing (2026-10-19)

- Both nRF54L15 boards flash with system OpenOCD 0.12 using the XIAO board's
  `~/ncs/v3.4.1/zephyr/boards/seeed/xiao_nrf54l15/support/openocd.cfg` (`nrf54l-load`):
  - XIAO: CMSIS-DAP (SAMD11 bridge) serial `AA2C939D`, ~59 KiB/s.
  - DK: same config with `OPENOCD_INTERFACE=jlink`, J-Link OB serial `001057713759`.
    No SEGGER software or nrfutil-device needed.
- The same config provides `nrf54l_mass_erase` (CTRL-AP ERASEALL) and auto-recovers an
  AP-locked chip on examine failure; `python -m tools.fw recover <board>` calls it.
- Blinky verified on both boards by sampling GPIO P2 OUT (`0x50050404`) over SWD:
  XIAO bit 0 (P2.0, LED0) and DK bit 9 (P2.9, LED0) toggle.
